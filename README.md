This is an example on how to use Active Directory (via LDAP) in ASP.Net Core 2 using the C# Novell LDAP library.

Rename `appsettings.github.json` to `appsettings.json` and enter your Active Directory details.

See my [blog](https://www.brechtbaekelandt.net/blog/post/authenticating-against-active-directory-with-aspnet-core-2-and-managing-users) for more information.
